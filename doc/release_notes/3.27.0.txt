= New Features

* A multibyte_string_matcher plugin has been added that supports
  multibyte characters in strings used as matchers.  It uses a slower
  string matching implementation that supports multibyte characters.
  As multibyte strings in paths must be escaped, this also loads the
  unescape_path plugin.

= Other Improvements

* The json_parser plugin now returns expected results for invalid JSON
  if the params_capturing plugin is used.

* lib/roda.rb has been split into multiple files for easier code
  navigation.
