= Improvements

* Multiple unneeded conditionals have been removed.

* pre_content and post_context sections in backtraces are no longer
  included in the exception_page plugin output if they would be
  empty.

* The match_affix plugin can be loaded again with a single argument.
  It was originally designed to accept a single argument, but a bug
  introduced in 2.29.0 made it require two arguments.

* Core Roda and all plugins that ship with Roda now have 100% branch
  coverage.

* The sinatra_helpers plugin no longer emits statement not reached
  warnings in verbose mode.
