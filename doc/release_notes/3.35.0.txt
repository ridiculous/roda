= New Features

* An r plugin has been added.  This plugin adds an r method for the
  request, useful for allowing the use of r.halt and r.redirect even
  in methods where the r local variable is not in scope.

= Other Improvements

* Attempting to load a plugin with an argument or block when the plugin
  does not accept arguments or a block now warns.  This is because a
  future update to support a block or an optional argument could break
  the call.
