= Improvements

* The new tilt 2.0.10 private API is now supported when using
  compiled template methods, with up to a 33% performance increase.
  The older tilt private API (back to tilt 1.2) is still supported.

* The performance of the render and view methods in the render plugin
  when called with only the :locals option are now about 75% faster
  by calling compiled template methods directly.

* Keyword argument separation issues are now handled on Ruby 2.7+
  when defining methods with blocks that accept keyword arguments.
