= New Features

* Asynchronous streaming is now supported in the streaming plugin,
  using the :async option.  When using this option, streaming
  responses are temporarily buffered in a queue.  By default, the
  queue is a sized queue with a maximum of 10 elements, but the
  queue can be specified manually via the :queue option, which
  can be used with async libraries that support non-blocking
  queues.  This option is currently only supported on Ruby 2.3+.

= Other Improvements

* When combining multiple compiled assets into a single file, the
  files are now separated by a newline, fixing issues when a
  single line comment is used as the last line of a file.
