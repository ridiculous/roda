= New Features

* render_each in the render_each plugin now automatically handles
  template names with subdirectories and extensions.  Previously, these
  caused issues unless the :local option was provided.  So now you
  can use:

    render_each(foos, "items/foo")

  instead of:

    render_each(foos, "items/foo", :local=>:foo)

* each_partial has been added to the partials plugin.  It operates
  similarly to render_each, but uses the convention for partial
  template naming.  So this:

    each_partial(foos, "items/foo")

  is the same as:

    render_each(foos, "items/_foo", :local=>:foo)

= Other Improvements

* The :dependencies option in the assets plugin now works correctly
  with compiled templates in the render plugin in uncached mode
  (the default in development).  Previously, modifying a dependency
  file would not result in recompiling the asset template when
  requesting the main file.

* Method visibility issues in the following plugins have been fixed:

  * content_security_policy
  * default_headers
  * indifferent_params
  * placeholder_string_matchers
  * symbol_matchers

  Previously, these plugins made private methods public by mistake
  when overriding them.  Additionally, Roda.freeze no longer changes
  the visibility of the set_default_headers private method.
