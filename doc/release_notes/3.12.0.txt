= New Features

* A common_logger plugin has been added for common log support. This
  offers about 30% better performance than Rack::CommonLogger, with
  the following differences:

  * When timing requests, doesn't consider middleware or proxy the
    body, so timing information is just the time that Roda takes
    to process the request.
  * Only looks for "Content-Length" as a header, not different
    capitalizations (Roda only uses "Content-Length" internally).
  * Logs to $stderr instead of rack.errors in request environment
    if a logger object is not explicitly passed.

= Other Improvements

* Internal before/after hook methods now use more descriptive names
  for easier debugging, with a naming format designed to not
  conflict with hook methods in external plugins.
