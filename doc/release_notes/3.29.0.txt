= Improvements

* The common_logger plugin now includes the SCRIPT_NAME when
  logging, for greater compatibility with typical web server
  logs.

* The exception_page plugin now handles invalid POST data.
  Previously, invalid POST data would cause the exception page
  display to raise an exception.

* An error is now raised if trying to load a plugin that is not a
  module or a recognized plugin symbol.

* Specs and older release notes are no longer shipped in the
  gem, reducing gem size by over 35%.
