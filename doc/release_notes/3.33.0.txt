= New Features

* The path plugin now supports a url method, allowing for returning
  the entire URL instead of just the path for class-based paths.

* The public plugin now supports a :brotli option that will directly
  serve brotli-compressed files (with .br extension) similar to how the
  :gzip option directly serves gzipped files (with the .gz extension).
