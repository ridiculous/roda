= New Features

* A multi_public plugin has been added, which allows serving static
  files from multiple separate directories.  This is especially
  useful when there are different access control requirements per
  directory.
  
* The content_security_policy now supports a
  content_security_policy.report_to method to set the
  report-to directive.

= Other Improvements

* When using the type_routing plugin and performing type routing
  using the Accept request header, the Vary response header will be
  added or updated so that http caches do not cache a response for one
  type and serve it for a different type.
