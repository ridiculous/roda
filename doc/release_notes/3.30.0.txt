= New Features

* A :relative_paths plugin option has been added to the assets
  plugin.  This option makes the paths to the asset files in the
  link and script tags relative paths instead of absolute paths.

= Other Improvements

* The :header matcher in the header_matchers plugin now works
  correctly for the Content-Type and Content-Length headers, which
  are not prefixed with HTTP_ in the rack environment.

* The run_append_slash and run_handler plugins now work correctly
  when used together.
