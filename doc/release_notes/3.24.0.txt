= Improvements

* The performance of the render_each plugin has been dramatically
  improved by calling compiled template methods directly. For a simple
  template, render_each performance with a single object can be about
  2x faster, and render_each performance for 100 objects can be 3x
  (cache: false) to 9x (cache: true) faster.

  This optimization can be used if no options are provided to
  render_each, or if :local and/or :locals options are provided. Use
  of other options will disable this optimization.

* The module_include plugin no longer calls Proc.new without a
  block, fixing a warning on Ruby 2.7.
