= New Features

* A relative_path plugin has been added, adding a relative_path
  method that will take an absolute path and make it relative to the
  current request by prepending an appropriate prefix.  This is
  helpful when using Roda as a static site generator to generate a
  site that can be hosted at any subpath or directly from the
  filesystem.

* In the path plugin, the path method now accepts a :relative
  option for generating relative paths instead of absolute paths.
