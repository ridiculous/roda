    # The static_routing plugin adds static_* routing class methods for handling
    # static routes (i.e. routes with static paths, no nesting or placeholders).  These
    # routes are processed before the normal routing tree and designed for
    # maximum performance.  This can be substantially faster than Roda's normal
    # tree based routing if you have large numbers of static routes, about 3-4x
    # for 100-10000 static routes.  Example:
    #
    #   plugin :static_routing
    #   
    #   static_route '/foo' do |r|
    #     @var = :foo
    #
    #     r.get do
    #       'Not actually reached'
    #     end
    #
    #     r.post{'static POST /#{@var}'}
    #   end
    #
    #   static_get '/foo' do |r|
    #     'static GET /foo'
    #   end
    #
    #   route do |r|
    #     'Not a static route'
    #   end
    #
    # A few things to note in the above example.  First, unlike most other
    # routing methods in Roda, these take the full path of the request, and only
    # match if r.path_info matches exactly.  This is why you need to include the
    # leading slash in the path argument.
    #
    # Second, the static_* routing methods only take a single string argument for
    # the path, they do not accept other options, and do not handle placeholders
    # in strings.  For any routes needing placeholders, you should use Roda's
    # routing tree.
    #
    # There are separate static_* methods for each type of request method, and these
    # request method specific routes are tried first.  There is also a static_route
    # method that will match regardless of the request method, if there is no
    # matching request methods specific route.  This is why the static_get
    # method call takes precedence over the static_route method call for /foo.
    # As shown above, you can use Roda's routing tree methods inside the
    # static_route block to have shared behavior for different request methods,
    # while still handling the request methods differently.

        # Add a static route for any request method.  These are
        # tried after the request method specific static routes (e.g.
        # static_get), but allow you to use Roda's routing tree
        # methods inside the route for handling shared behavior while
        # still allowing request method specific handling.
